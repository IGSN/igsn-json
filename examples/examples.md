# Examples

These are examples of simple JSON documents to give you an intuitive feel for how they should be structured.

We provide the examples in YAML so that they're easier to read (and because JSON doesn't support comments), but you can convert these to JSON with the Python script pretty easily:

```bash
$ python convert.py minimal_registration.yaml
{
    "@context": "http://schema.igsn.org/json/registration/v0.1/context.jsonld",
    "igsn": {
        "kind": "igsn",
        "id": "XXXCSIRO0001"
    },
    "registrant": {
        "name": "CSIRO",
        "identifiers": [
            {
                "kind": "orcid",
                "id": "0001-0001-0001-0001"
            },
            {
                "kind": "viaf",
                "id": "https://csiro.au/path/to/viaf.file"
            },
            {
                "kind": "uri",
                "id": "https://csiro.au"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

which should also play nicely with other Unix-y tools

```bash
$ python convert.py minimal_registration.yaml | jq '.registratnt.identifiers[].kind'
"orcid"
"viaf"
"uri"
```

You need to install click and pyyaml for this to work. You can get all of these using the Pipfile in the root directory:

```bash
$ cd path/to/igsn_json
$ pipenv install  # or pipenv install --dev for all the dev tools
Installing dependencies from Pipfile.lock (e3dedb)â€¦
  ============================---- 8/9 - 00:00:05
...
```

Once installed, you can run the scripts in an isolated environment with the `pipenv shell` command.

```bash
$ pipenv shell
Launching subshell in virtual environment...
# do whatever you were going to do in the new shell
```

## IGSN Metadata structure

IGSN metadata is split into registration (or core) metadata, which is very minimal, and descriptive (or community) metadata, which containst all the actual 'information' about a sample such as scientific observations, sampling locations etc.

## Custom data about a sample

The `data` key can contain any extra information about a sample

### Basic data (without JSON-LD)

### Semantic context from JSON-LD

- Pointing to an IGSN context
- Pointing to another JSON-LD context
