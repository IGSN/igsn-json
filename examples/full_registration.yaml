# title: Full registration example
# description: >
#   This is an example of a full set of IGSN registration data, in YAML format
#   so that we can document the choices here. This includes all registration
# metadata fields

---
# We include the IGSN JSON-LD context here - this provides semantic labels
# for each of our keys in the document. This is a fixed constant for the
# IGSN data to be valid.
"@context": http://schema.igsn.org/json/registration/v0.1/context.jsonld

# This is the identifier that we are talking about. All identifier objects
# have a 'kind' key indicating what sort of identifier they are, and an id
# key pointing to a URI or resource definition
igsn: XXXCSIRO0001 # or igsn.org/XXXCSIRO0001 etc

# This is the information about the allocating agent responsible for
# publishing the information about this sample.
# Note that you can have multiple identifiers pointing to the same agent
